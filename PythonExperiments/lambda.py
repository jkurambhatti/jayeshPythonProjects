'''
    now we are going to lean about "lambda" function in python
    a lambda function is a small nameless fn and is called only once and never again
    any function which you want to use just once and name is not important should be declared as lambda
    example :
    declare a function which returns square of the number passed
    applications : see later

'''


result = lambda x: x * x
print result(5)
